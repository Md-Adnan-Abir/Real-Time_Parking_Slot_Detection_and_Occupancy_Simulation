# Real-Time_Parking_Slot_Detection_and_Occupancy_Simulation
This project presents a real-time parking slot monitoring and simulation system that leverages computer vision techniques to detect parking occupancy dynamically. Using OpenCV for image processing and Streamlit for visualization, the system processes video feeds to identify occupied and free parking spaces.
